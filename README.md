Hi! I'm a Junior Backend Developer. I love Neovim, slinging code directly in the terminal, and contributing to open-source projects.

Currently, I'm diving into Bash scripting to automate and build tools in Linux environments.

##### What I'm building right now
Most of my projects focus on creating CLIs for people who, like me, prefer staying in the command line.

I love Adventure Time and video games (I might learn more C soon to start creating my own 2D games).

Learn as much as you can, use your favorite tools, and most importantly: **love turtles**!
